# Development log

This is a running, session-by-session development log — the build's
working notes, not a polished document. Most of the implementation was
done with AI coding agents under my direction (see the README's "Notes"
section), and these entries capture the decisions, dead ends, and
fixes from each session: what changed, why, and what was next. It is
kept for provenance and as a record of the reasoning behind the code,
and reads newest-context-first within each session rather than top to
bottom.

## Changes Made This Session (2026-06-30 — Build Your Briefing (filters) rebuilt in the LIGHT register + shared two contexts)

### iOS — Onboarding step 2 + settings filters rebuilt to the light world

Rebuilt the **filters / Build Your Briefing** screen into the locked LIGHT
register and made it ONE shared screen used in TWO contexts (onboarding +
settings), so they can never drift apart. The tri-state tree LOGIC
(`FilterTreeModel`) is reused verbatim — this was a re-skin + a shared-component
extraction, not a logic rewrite.

**Decision (with Paul):** the tree's data source is the REAL backend taxonomy
(`GET /data/categories`), NOT the `TopicSeed` placeholder — the created profile
must match what the user actually toggled. Onboarding finish still creates a
backend profile (POST) + sets `didOnboard`, so Home Play keeps working.
Selections also persist as leaf-id JSON for the settings-context rehydration.

**Backend taxonomy shape (confirmed against prod):** 2-level — groups
(Politics, World, Business, Technology, Entertainment, Sport) carry
subcategories; some groups (Science, Climate, Health) are flat (empty
subcategories) and render as single toggle rows. `TopicNode.tree(from:)` maps
both cleanly. No 3rd-level nesting exists in the live data; the partial/half
state still works (parent → partial when only some children are on).

**New — `Shared/Components/BottomActionBar.swift`**
- Extracted the locked footer (inset hairline rule + CTA label left + shared
  `MachinedDisc` arrow right, `arrowDiam = 56`) into one component. Create
  Profile + both filter contexts now use it, so the footer is identical.

**New — `Features/Filters/LightFilterTree.swift`**
- Light skin of the tri-state tree: `LightToggle` (filled dark = on, outline
  grey = off, centred knob + dot = partial), `LightFilterRowView` (ink caps via
  `Font.label`, hairline dividers, staggered indent, parent bolder/larger),
  `LightFilterTreeView`. Drives the SAME `FilterTreeModel` (cascade/partial/
  expand reused unchanged); the dark `FilterTreeView`/`BoardToggle` stay for the
  board world.

**New — `Features/Filters/FiltersScreen.swift`**
- The shared light screen, parameterised by context: `ctaLabel`,
  `showStepIndicator`, `initialSelection` (nil → onboarding defaults), and an
  async `onComplete(leafIDs)`. Owns category load (real backend), the model,
  loading/failed/ready states, optional "2 OF 2", the scrolling tree, and the
  pinned footer (BottomActionBar + soft fade). Onboarding defaults pre-light the
  `world` + `business` groups.
- Also holds `ProfileFiltersView` — the SETTINGS-context wrapper: loads the
  user's current profile, pre-lights its `includeCategories`, CTA "DONE", no
  step indicator; saves edited categories back via `updateProfile` (preserving
  name/duration/topStories), persists the JSON, dismisses. Falls back to the
  saved leaf-id JSON if the profile can't be read.

**`Features/Onboarding/BuildBriefingView.swift`** — rewritten as a thin
onboarding wrapper over `FiltersScreen` (CTA "COMPLETE SETUP", defaults, step
indicator). Finish = create profile (slugs from leaf-ids) → persist id + JSON →
`didOnboard = true` → `onContinue()`. Struct name + signature unchanged, so the
launch flow (createProfile → buildBriefing → home) is untouched.

**`Features/Onboarding/CreateProfileView.swift`** — footer swapped to the shared
`BottomActionBar` (no behaviour change; guarantees identical footer).

**`Features/Home/HomeContainerView.swift`** — the "P" now presents
`ProfileFiltersView` (settings context) via `fullScreenCover`, replacing the old
`ProfileSheet`/`ProfileFormView` sheet. NOTE: the now-unused private
`ProfileSheet` struct + the `ProfileFormView` file are left in place (dead code)
pending confirmation before deletion.

**`Headlines.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`** — registered the 3 new files.

### State
- Builds with 0 errors. Verified on sim against the prod backend: onboarding
  context (no heading, "2 OF 2", real categories, World+Business pre-lit,
  "COMPLETE SETUP" + arrow); a parent (World) expanded showing nested children
  with one child off → parent renders the partial half-toggle (cascade logic =
  unchanged `FilterTreeModel`); and the settings context via the "P" — same
  tree/toggles/footer, "DONE", no step indicator, pre-loaded with profile 1's
  real selections (Politics on, Business + Sport partial).

### Next Step
- Decide whether to delete the dead `ProfileSheet`/`ProfileFormView` now that the
  light filters screen owns profile editing. Wire real categories' default
  pre-lit set once the taxonomy is finalised (currently world + business).

## Changes Made This Session (2026-06-30 — Create Profile rebuilt in the LIGHT register)

### iOS — Onboarding step 1 rebuilt to the locked light world

Rebuilt the onboarding **Create Profile / name-entry** screen from the old
dark full-screen world into the locked LIGHT register: a contained dark
flap-board card on a near-white page, matching the home's material language.

**New — `ios/Headlines/Headlines/Shared/Theme/MachinedDisc.swift`**
- Extracted the Home Play button's machined-disc material into a shared
  `MachinedDisc` view + `MachinedDiscButtonStyle` (radial charcoal gradient +
  top-edge highlight + matte grain + soft drop shadow + press-in) so the Play
  disc and the onboarding/filters forward arrow render pixel-identically.
- Also holds the shared `Triangle` (play) and new `ForwardArrow` (→) shapes.
- `MachinedDisc(dimmed:)` drops the whole control back for disabled states.

**`ios/Headlines/Headlines/Shared/Theme/Board.swift`**
- Added `LightColors` tokens — `page` `#F7F7F5`, `ink` `#141414` — the light
  register shared by the new home, Create Profile, and (next) the filters screen.

**`ios/Headlines/Headlines/Features/Home/HomeView.swift`**
- Refactored `playButton` to compose the shared `MachinedDisc` /
  `MachinedDiscButtonStyle`; removed its private `Triangle` + `PlayButtonStyle`.
  Output is pixel-identical (verified on sim) — position/size unchanged so the
  coordinate-based Home UI tests still pass.

**`ios/Headlines/Headlines/Features/Onboarding/CreateProfileView.swift`**
- Full rewrite to the light register: near-white page; a contained dark
  flap-board card with "CREATE PROFILE" on shared `FlapCell` tiles (the one
  flap moment) + a real `TextField` whose placeholder ("What is your name?")
  sits ON the input line at the same size the typed name displays. Typed name
  renders off-white plain text (NOT cells) with a visible caret.
- Locked footer pattern: an inset hairline rule (margins both sides), a
  "BUILD YOUR BRIEFING" CTA label (`Font.label`, ink caps) on the left, and the
  machined forward-arrow disc bottom-right. Both lit only when a non-empty name
  is entered, dim/disabled when empty.
- Tap-outside dismisses the keyboard; arrow/`onSubmit` persists `userName` and
  advances. `didOnboard` is still NOT set here (set after the filters step).
- `StepDots` kept (used by the dark filters screen `BuildBriefingView`); Create
  Profile uses its own light "1 OF 2" label instead.

**`ios/Headlines/Headlines.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`**
- Registered `MachinedDisc.swift` in the Theme group + Sources build phase
  (project lists files manually — not synchronized groups).

### Routing
- Launch flow unchanged: `HeadlinesApp` still routes
  `.createProfile → CreateProfileView { phase = .buildBriefing }`. The struct
  name + `onContinue` signature are preserved, so the new light version drops
  straight into the existing loader → onboarding → home gating.

### State
- Builds with 0 errors. Verified on the iPhone 17 Pro sim: empty state
  (placeholder on the line, arrow + CTA dimmed), typed state ("Paul" off-white
  with caret, placeholder cleared, arrow + CTA lit), and Home Play button
  unchanged after the disc extraction.

### Next Step
- Build the **filters screen** to the same light register using the locked
  footer pattern + the same `MachinedDisc` arrow (same `arrowDiam = 56`).

## Changes Made This Session (2026-05-25 — iOS device fixes, TestFlight prep, cost model restructure)

### iOS — Build fixes

**`ios/Headlines/Headlines/Core/BulletinPlayer.swift`**
- Swift 6 concurrency fix: wrapped `handlePeriodicTime` call in `MainActor.assumeIsolated` (line ~377) — compiler error: `Call to main actor-isolated method in synchronous nonisolated context`
- KVO nil-emission bug fix: added `guard playerState != .buffering else { return }` in `handleCurrentItemChanged` — `AVQueuePlayer` fires `currentItemChanged → nil` during init before items become current; previously caused premature `.ended` state → Play button disabled

**`ios/Headlines/Headlines/Features/Briefing/BriefingView.swift`**
- Updated `onChange(of:perform:)` to two-parameter form `{ _, phase in` — deprecated in iOS 17

### iOS — TestFlight prep

**`ios/Headlines/Headlines/Info.plist`**
- Added `UIBackgroundModes: [audio]` — required for AVAudioSession to keep playing when screen locks or app is backgrounded
- Added `NSExceptionDomains` entry for `<dev-machine-ip>` (LAN IP) — `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` only covers `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`; Release builds need explicit ATS exception for LAN IP

### Backend — Cost model restructure (GNews-only pull, LLM+TTS on-demand only)

**`backend/src/core/platform/config/settings.py`**
- Added `enable_llm_categorise_fallback: bool = True`

**`backend/.env`**
- Added `# ENABLE_LLM_CATEGORISE_FALLBACK=true` toggle comment

**`backend/src/core/pipeline/data/normalise/categorise/category_service.py`**
- Gated Haiku categorisation fallback on `settings.enable_llm_categorise_fallback` — early return to `unclassified` when disabled

**`backend/src/core/pipeline/data/summarise/handlers/rank_completed.py`**
- Extracted `ensure_story_summaries(ranking_run_id, story_ids)` as public function — 3-phase pattern: DB reads → parallel LLM (`ThreadPoolExecutor`, max 6 workers) → persist
- Content-addressed cache: reuses `(story_id, content_hash, model)` rows from any previous run — zero LLM calls on cache hit
- `handle_rank_completed` simplified to: deduplicate IDs → `ensure_story_summaries()` → emit outbox event

**`backend/src/core/pipeline/devtools/pull_stories.py`**
- Removed step 6 (LLM summarisation); now 5 steps — pull → normalise → cluster → categorise → rank
- Summary line: `Paid API calls: GNews only (LLM categorise fallback if needed)`

**`backend/src/core/api/routes/data.py`**
- Added `_SUMMARISE_BUDGET = 12` constant
- Refactored `_get_or_assemble_bulletin()` into two-session pattern:
  - Session 1: ranking run lookup + cache check + candidate extraction (no summaries yet)
  - `ensure_story_summaries()` call (no DB held open during LLM calls)
  - Session 2: read summaries, select by duration, assemble, persist bulletin

### Verification results
- `pull_stories`: GNews only, 0 LLM calls, 0 TTS ✅
- Cold Generate: 7 parallel LLM calls, 10 TTS background tasks, 7.56s manifest response
- Warm Generate (full cache): 0 LLM, 0 TTS, ~100ms
- New bulletin with shared stories: 0 LLM, 3 TTS (new segment text only), ~105ms

### Current State
- iOS: archive-ready except for app icon (user to provide 1024×1024 PNG, no alpha) and `API_BASE_URL` User-Defined build setting in Xcode
- Backend: pull_stories is free (GNews only); all LLM+TTS deferred to Generate time
- Next: app icon + Xcode build setting, then archive → TestFlight

---

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-30 — Step 3 server completion + iOS streaming player)

### Server-side (Step 3 pre-iOS cleanup)

**Modified `platform/config/settings.py`:**
- Added `public_api_base_url: str = "http://localhost:8000"` — used by manifest endpoint to construct absolute URLs

**Modified `api/routes/profiles.py`:**
- Manifest endpoint now uses `settings.public_api_base_url.rstrip("/")` to construct absolute URLs for all segment URLs
- Story segments now include `"title"` field populated from `stories_list[].headline` — required for iOS lock screen / now playing info

### iOS — Step 3 streaming playback (chunks a–h complete)

**New `ios/.../Models/BulletinManifest.swift`:**
- `ManifestSegment`: index, type, url, durationMs, storyHash, storyId, title; computed `isStory`, `durationSeconds`
- `BulletinManifest`: bulletinId, rankingRunId, segments

**New `ios/.../Core/BulletinPlayer.swift`:**
- `@MainActor ObservableObject` backed by `AVQueuePlayer`
- **a. Audio session:** `setCategory(.playback)` + interruption handler (pause on began, resume if shouldResume) + route change handler (pause on headphone unplug)
- **b+c. Sliding window:** `enqueueNext()` called twice initially; item N's `readyToPlay` triggers N+2 pre-fetch via Combine publisher; `automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling = false`
- **d. Event firing:** `addPeriodicTimeObserver` at 0.1s; `currentPositionPct` = positionSeconds / durationSeconds; "completed" fires on natural item advancement, "skipped" on skip(), "abandoned" on sendSummary()
- **e. Skip:** fires "skipped" event, removes following transition if present, calls `advanceToNextItem()`
- **f. Failure paths:** 4s stall timeout (2×2s); item failure (503) → silent skip via `handleItemFailed()`; manifest fetch failure → `state = .failed(msg)`
- **g. Lock screen:** `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` updated on segment change (title, artist "Headlines", duration, chapter N of M); `MPRemoteCommandCenter` play/pause/nextTrack
- **h. Summary + lifecycle:** `sendSummary()` batches accumulated events + current abandoned event via `POST /data/bulletins/{id}/summary`; `accumulatedEvents` accumulates per-session events for the safety net
- State machine: idle → loadingManifest → buffering → playing/paused/stalled → ended/failed

**Replaced `ios/.../Features/Briefing/BriefingViewModel.swift`:**
- Removed `AudioPlayer` + `BulletinService` dependencies
- Added `BulletinPlayer` owned by the VM; Combine sinks forward player state to `BriefingViewModel.State`
- `generateBulletin()` → `bulletinPlayer.load(profileId:)`
- `bulletin: BulletinResult?` synthesised from manifest (stories with title+storyHash, no startTime)
- `handleBackground()` / `handleForeground()` for lifecycle (5-min re-fetch on foreground)

**Modified `ios/.../Features/Briefing/BriefingView.swift`:**
- Added `@Environment(\.scenePhase)` + `.onChange(of:)` → `vm.handleBackground/Foreground()`
- State label: `.generating` → "Fetching bulletin…", `.downloadingAudio` → "Preparing audio…"
- `.buffering` maps to `.readyToPlay` — PlayerView shows immediately after manifest loads

**Updated Xcode project (`project.pbxproj`):**
- Added `BulletinPlayer.swift` to Core group
- Added `BulletinManifest.swift` to Models group
- Both in Sources build phase

**Build result:** `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **` (no errors, iOS Simulator target)

### Current State
- Server: manifest endpoint returns absolute URLs + title fields; user_story_state tracking complete
- iOS: full streaming playback implemented; events fire; lock screen works; lifecycle handled
- Next: device testing, PlaybackView migration (old AVAudioPlayer-based flow still exists in PlaybackView)

## What Is Working

### Full event chain (end-to-end: Ingest → Normalise → Cluster → Categorise → Rank → Summarise)

```
data.ingest.requested
  → handle_ingest_requested        → data.normalise.requested
  → handle_normalise_requested     → data.cluster.requested
  → handle_cluster_requested       → data.cluster.completed
  → handle_cluster_completed       → data.categorise.completed
  → handle_categorise_completed    → persists to data.ranking_runs
                                   → data.rank.completed
  → handle_rank_completed          → persists to data.story_summaries (when API key set)
                                   → data.summarise.completed
```

### Registered handlers (registry_wiring.py)

| Event | Handler |
|---|---|
| `data.ingest.requested` | `handle_ingest_requested` |
| `data.normalise.requested` | `handle_normalise_requested` |
| `data.cluster.requested` | `handle_cluster_requested` |
| `data.cluster.completed` | `handle_cluster_completed` (categorise) |
| `data.categorise.completed` | `handle_categorise_completed` (ranking) |
| `data.rank.completed` | `handle_rank_completed` (summarise) |
| `data.summarise.requested` | `handle_summarise_requested` (stub, unused) |
| `feeds.requested` | `handle_feeds_requested` |
| `scripts.requested` | `handle_scripts_requested` |
| `audio.requested` | `handle_audio_requested` |

### Categorisation System (article-level, in normalise handler)

- `normalise/categorise/` — entity matching + category matching from YAML taxonomy
- Runs during normalisation; writes `category_primary`, `category_slugs` to `data.normalisation_articles`

### Story-level Categorisation (new, post-cluster)

- `pipeline/data/categorise/handlers/cluster_completed.py`
- Listens to `data.cluster.completed`
- Majority-vote across all articles per story to resolve `primary_category`
- Updates `data.stories.primary_category` where changed
- Emits `data.categorise.completed`

### Ranking Module

- `ranking/scorer.py`, `category_ranker.py`, `selection.py`, `ranker.py` — complete (see session 2)
- `ranking/handlers/categorise_completed.py` — loads all 48h candidates, runs `StoryRanker.rank()`, persists to `data.ranking_runs`
- `ranking/repos/ranking_run_repo.py` — inserts ranking run as JSONB; `get_latest()` for API use

### Database Schema (all migrations applied)

- `data.ingested_articles`
- `data.normalisation_articles` — with `category_slugs`, `category_primary`, `story_id`
- `data.entities` + `data.normalisation_article_entities`
- `data.stories` + `data.story_articles`
- `data.ranking_runs` — `batch_id` (UNIQUE), `candidate_count`, `top_stories` JSONB, `briefing` JSONB
- `data.story_summaries` — `story_id`, `ranking_run_id`, `content_hash`, `headline`, `summary_text`, `why_it_matters`, `audio_script`, `model`, `summary_version`, `confidence`, UNIQUE(story_id, ranking_run_id), INDEX(story_id, content_hash, model)

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-25, session 6 — LLM fallback categoriser)

**Architecture:**
Two-pass categorisation. YAML always runs first (unchanged precision). If YAML returns score=0 across all rules, Claude Haiku is asked to classify from the exact list of valid slugs. Only persisted if confidence ≥ 0.85.

**New files:**
- `categorise/llm_fallback.py` — `classify_fallback(title, snippet, valid_slugs) → FallbackResult | None`
  - Uses stdlib `urllib.request` (no new dependency)
  - `FALLBACK_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.85`
  - Validates returned slug is in the permitted list (no hallucinated categories)
  - Logs ACCEPTED/REJECTED decisions at INFO level
  - Returns `None` silently if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not set or API call fails
- `devtools/fallback_inspect.py` — preview/apply fallback decisions on uncategorised articles
  - Run: `cd backend && .venv/bin/python src/core/pipeline/devtools/fallback_inspect.py`
  - Apply to DB: add `--apply` flag

**Modified files:**
- `categorise/category_loader.py` — added `load_valid_category_slugs()` (reads categories.yml, returns 43 leaf slugs including `science`, `health`, `climate`)
- `categorise/category_service.py` — calls fallback when YAML returns empty; stores `method="llm-fallback"`, optional `fallback_confidence/reason` fields
- `platform/config/settings.py` — added `anthropic_api_key: str | None = None`
- `.env` — added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` placeholder

**Test coverage:** 17 unit tests (mock-based) covering: accepted, rejected, invalid slug, malformed JSON, code-fence JSON, HTTP error, missing key, category_service integration.

**Expected impact (simulation on 45 uncategorised articles):**
- Before: 47/92 = 51% categorised
- After (+31 accepted, 12 rejected below threshold): 78/92 = **85%** categorised
- Rejected examples (correctly left uncategorised): WFH four-day week (0.74), Killin water supply (0.72), local crime articles (0.77-0.83)
- Accepted examples: Tyson Fury boxing (0.97), NASA mission (0.95), Assassin's Creed gaming (0.96), Scottish election (0.94), Ukraine war (0.93)

**Production hardening — all 27 checks passed:**
- Provider: model read from `FALLBACK_MODEL` env var, isolated in `_model()`, no model-name branches in logic
- Safety: fallback gated strictly on `if not ranked`, `--apply` required, `WHERE category_primary IS NULL` double-guard
- Schema: 43-slug allowlist from categories.yml, confidence range [0.0,1.0] validated, JSON fail-closed
- Observability: `article_id` on every log line (devtool passes it explicitly), ACCEPTED/REJECTED at INFO
- Persistence: `--apply` touches only `category_primary`, `category_slugs`, `category_method`, `category_version`

**Actual results after apply:**
- Before: 47/92 = 51% categorised
- Applied: 31 accepted (≥0.85 confidence), 14 rejected
- After: 78/92 = **85%** categorised
- Remaining 14 are appropriately ambiguous (local crime 0.77-0.83, lifestyle 0.73-0.82)

**To run on real data:**
1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key>` to `.env`
2. `cd backend && .venv/bin/python src/core/pipeline/devtools/fallback_inspect.py`
3. Review output, then re-run with `--apply` to write to DB

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-25, session 5 — YAML hardening pass)

**Modified:**
- `taxonomy/entities.yml`:
  - Removed person entities: `taylor-swift`, `lewis-hamilton`, `max-verstappen`, `charles-leclerc`, `oscar-piastri`, `carlos-sainz` (persons are not durable taxonomy anchors)
  - Removed noisy single-word aliases: `labour`, `england`, `ashes`, `switch` (would match unrelated text)
  - Changed `apple` alias from `"apple"` to `"apple inc"` (avoids non-tech apple matches)
  - Removed `"meta"` alias from meta entity (avoids "meta-analysis", "meta narrative" matches; `"facebook"` retained)
- `taxonomy/rules.yml`:
  - Added `climate:` section (climate change, carbon emissions, net zero, global warming, fossil fuels + cop/ipcc entities)
  - Added `health:` section (mental health, clinical trial, cancer diagnosis, vaccine + nhs/world-health-organization entities)
  - `politics.uk`: added `"home secretary"`, `"whitehall"`
  - `world.uk`: removed `"alleged victims"`, `"police investigation"`, `"criminal charges"` (too broad)
  - `technology.companies`: removed `"apple"`, `"meta"` keywords (entity-based detection handles these)
  - `technology.consumer`: removed `"device"` (too broad)
  - `entertainment.music`: removed `"single"`, `"tour"` (too broad); added `"monty python"` to tv-film
  - `sport.football.premier-league`: added `"nottingham forest"`
  - `sport.football.championship`: changed `"championship"` → `"efl championship"` (avoids golf/academics)
  - `sport.golf.pga`: changed `"masters"` → `"augusta"` (avoids Masters degrees)
  - `sport.cricket.international`: changed `"ashes"` → `"the ashes"` (avoids religious matches)
- `cluster/handlers/requested.py`: added `_HINT_STOPWORDS`, `_extract_title_hint()`, two-condition hint+category dedup for non-entity articles; `is_clustering_anchor` guard (countries excluded from entity-based clustering)
- `categorise/category_matcher.py`: country entity boost reduced 5.0→1.5

**Created:**
- `devtools/cluster_hint_test.py` — 20 tests for hint extraction and clustering logic (all passing)

**Data fixes:**
- Article 47 `category_primary` corrected from `lewis-hamilton` (invalid entity slug) to `sport.formula1`
- All 92 `normalisation_articles` recategorised in-place with current YAML; 51% categorisation rate (up from ~46%)

**Validation:**
- 20/20 noise probes passing (apple/meta false positives eliminated)
- 0 invalid `category_primary` values
- 1 mixed cluster (story 5: Iran/FTSE — acceptable crossover on the same story)
- Top ranking: world.middle-east, politics.uk, world.asia, world.europe, sport.football

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-24, session 4+)

**Created:**
- `pipeline/devtools/show_latest_ranking_run.py` — prints the latest `data.ranking_runs` row with all scoring fields
- `api/routes/data.py` — added `GET /data/ranking/latest` endpoint

**Verified:**
- Full event chain end-to-end (ingest → normalise → cluster → categorise → rank)
- `data.ranking_runs` receives one row per unique categorisation batch
- Idempotency: replaying the same `data.categorise.completed` does not create duplicate rows (UniqueViolation on `ux_data_ranking_runs_batch_id`)
- Migration `3e8f9a2b1c7d` applied

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-24, session 3)

**Created:**
- `pipeline/data/cluster/events.py` — added `DATA_CLUSTER_COMPLETED`
- `pipeline/data/categorise/__init__.py`
- `pipeline/data/categorise/events.py` — `DATA_CATEGORISE_COMPLETED`
- `pipeline/data/categorise/handlers/__init__.py`
- `pipeline/data/categorise/handlers/cluster_completed.py` — story-level categorisation
- `pipeline/ranking/events.py` — `DATA_RANK_COMPLETED` (for future downstream stages)
- `pipeline/ranking/handlers/__init__.py`
- `pipeline/ranking/handlers/categorise_completed.py` — ranking handler
- `pipeline/ranking/repos/__init__.py`
- `pipeline/ranking/repos/ranking_run_repo.py` — `RankingRunRepo`
- `alembic/versions/3e8f9a2b1c7d_add_ranking_runs.py` — `data.ranking_runs` table

**Modified:**
- `pipeline/data/cluster/handlers/requested.py` — collects `affected_story_ids`, imports OutboxRepo/Event, emits `data.cluster.completed` before commit
- `platform/queue/registry_wiring.py` — registered `handle_cluster_completed` and `handle_categorise_completed`

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-25, session 10 — TTS / audio generation)

**Architecture:**
Audio generation is cached by `(bulletin_id, script_hash, provider, voice, model, audio_format)`. Script hash is SHA-256 of the bulletin script (16 chars). Provider/voice/model read from env vars at call time. Uses stdlib `urllib.request` — no new dependencies. Files stored to `{audio_local_dir}/bulletins/{bulletin_id}_{script_hash}.{ext}` (absolute path). Assembly commits before audio is attempted: a TTS failure never rolls back the bulletin.

**New files:**
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/audio/__init__.py`
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/audio/tts_client.py`
  - `synthesize(text, *, provider, voice, model, audio_format) → bytes | None` — dispatches to ElevenLabs or OpenAI
  - `compute_script_hash(script) → str` — 16-char SHA-256
  - `ext_from_format(audio_format) → str` — mp3/pcm/opus
  - `tts_provider/voice/model/audio_format()` — read env vars at call time, never cached
  - ElevenLabs: POST `/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}?output_format={fmt}`, `xi-api-key` header
  - OpenAI: POST `/v1/audio/speech`, `Authorization: Bearer` header
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/audio/repos/bulletin_audio_repo.py`
  - `get_cached(bulletin_id, script_hash, provider, voice, model, audio_format) → dict | None`
  - `insert(...)` — `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` + fallback SELECT (returns existing id either way)

**Migration `f8a9b0c1d2e3`:**
```sql
data.bulletin_audio (
    id, bulletin_id FK data.bulletins(id),
    script_hash TEXT, provider TEXT, voice TEXT,
    model TEXT, audio_format TEXT, storage_path TEXT,
    duration_seconds REAL, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    UNIQUE(bulletin_id, script_hash, provider, voice, model, audio_format)
)
```

**Modified files:**
- `platform/config/settings.py` — added `tts_provider`, `tts_voice`, `tts_model`, `tts_audio_format`, `elevenlabs_api_key`, `openai_api_key`
- `.env` — added TTS env var stubs (`TTS_PROVIDER=elevenlabs`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=` placeholder)
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/repos/bulletin_repo.py` — added `get_by_id(bulletin_id)`
- `api/routes/data.py` — added `_generate_audio()` helper, `POST /data/bulletins/{bulletin_id}/audio`, `POST /data/bulletins/assemble-and-audio`

**Env vars required:**
```
TTS_PROVIDER=elevenlabs           # or openai
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<key>          # required when provider=elevenlabs
OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>              # required when provider=openai
TTS_VOICE=JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb   # ElevenLabs "George" (British male); optional override
TTS_MODEL=eleven_turbo_v2_5       # optional override
TTS_AUDIO_FORMAT=mp3_44100_128    # optional override
```

**API responses:**

`POST /data/bulletins/{bulletin_id}/audio`:
```json
{
  "bulletin_id": 2, "audio_id": 1, "script_hash": "01cc38ee330c4060",
  "provider": "elevenlabs", "voice": "JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb",
  "model": "eleven_turbo_v2_5", "audio_format": "mp3_44100_128",
  "storage_path": "/abs/path/.local/audio/bulletins/2_01cc38ee330c4060.mp3",
  "duration_seconds": null, "cached": true
}
```

`POST /data/bulletins/assemble-and-audio`:
```json
{
  "ranking_run_id": 13, "bulletin_id": 2, "request_hash": "44136fa355b3678a",
  "story_count": 11, "bulletin_cached": true,
  "audio_id": 1, "script_hash": "01cc38ee330c4060",
  "provider": "elevenlabs", "voice": "JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb",
  "model": "eleven_turbo_v2_5", "audio_format": "mp3_44100_128",
  "storage_path": "/abs/path/.local/audio/bulletins/2_01cc38ee330c4060.mp3",
  "duration_seconds": null, "audio_cached": true
}
```

**Validation (5 of 5 cases, no live API key needed for cache/fail-close cases):**
1. Generate audio for bulletin 2 (seeded) → `audio_id=1  cached=True` ✓
2. Repeat same request → `cached=True  audio_id=1` (no new row) ✓
3. Different bulletin (id=3, politics) → separate audio path (503 — no key) ✓ (different path in DB)
4. Same script/provider/voice/model → 1 row in DB after 5 calls ✓ (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`)
5. Missing API key → `503 TTS provider unavailable`, 0 DB rows ✓
6. assemble-and-audio: both bulletin+audio cached → `bulletin_cached=True  audio_cached=True` ✓
7. assemble-and-audio: invalid category → 422 before any DB/TTS work ✓
8. Assembly commits before TTS: bulletin persisted even when audio 503s ✓

**To generate real audio:**
1. Add `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<key>` to `.env`
2. `POST /data/bulletins/2/audio` → generates MP3, stores to `.local/audio/bulletins/`
3. Repeat → returns `cached=true`

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-25, session 11 — local dev dashboard)

**Architecture:**
Read-only dev dashboard served by the existing FastAPI app at `/dev`. Zero changes to any pipeline logic. New router mounts at `/dev`; all `/dev/api/*` endpoints are inspection-only (no side effects). Dashboard HTML calls both inspection endpoints and the real product APIs.

**New files:**
- `api/routes/dev.py` — inspection router (all read-only)
  - `GET /dev` — serves HTML dashboard
  - `GET /dev/api/pipeline` — ranking runs (with summary/bulletin/audio counts), bulletins, audio, event outbox summary
  - `GET /dev/api/stories` — stories in ranking order with articles, categories, entity links
  - `GET /dev/api/summaries` — summaries with full fields + word count + tier
  - `GET /dev/api/categories` — 43 valid category slugs from YAML taxonomy (for filter UI)
  - `GET /dev/api/audio/{bulletin_id}/file` — serves MP3 from `data.bulletin_audio.storage_path` (local dev only)
- `api/routes/dev_dashboard.html` — single-file HTML/CSS/JS dashboard (~470 lines, no dependencies)

**Modified files:**
- `api/router.py` — added `dev_router` include (only change to existing files)

**Dashboard tabs:**
1. **Pipeline** — Ranking runs table (id, candidates, summaries, avg confidence, bulletins, audio); Bulletins table; Audio files table; Event outbox summary by type/status
2. **Stories** — Stories in ranking order (TOP/BRIEFING badge, category, title, article count, expandable article list with per-article category method/entity)
3. **Summaries** — Summary cards in ranking order (expandable: summary_text, why_it_matters, audio_script, confidence, model, content_hash)
4. **Bulletin Builder** — Category multi-select (43 cats from taxonomy), max_stories, [Assemble] [Assemble+Audio] [Get Latest] buttons, inline script preview, inline `<audio>` player
5. **Audio** — Audio file list (click to play), embedded `<audio>` element, file size + estimated duration

**Local URL:** `http://localhost:8001/dev`

**Validation (10/10):**
1. `/dev` loads ✓ — HTML returned correctly
2. Pipeline timeline ✓ — 10 runs, 7 bulletins, 2 audio files, outbox by type
3. Stories ✓ — 11 stories, ranking order, articles with categories + entities
4. Summaries ✓ — 11 summaries, confidence, word count, all fields
5. Assemble filtered bulletin ✓ — politics filter → 4 stories, new hash
6. Generate/fetch audio ✓ — bulletin 8 cached, audio_id=3
7. Audio player ✓ — `GET /dev/api/audio/8/file` returns `200 audio/mpeg` (2.8MB)
8. Cached repeat ✓ — `bulletin_cached=True  audio_cached=True`
9. Real backend APIs ✓ — JS calls `/data/*` and `/dev/api/*` (no mock data)
10. No core logic changed ✓ — only `router.py` + 2 new files added

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-25, session 9 — user-specific bulletin assembly)

**Architecture:**
Bulletins are now request-specific rather than global. `POST /data/bulletins/assemble` accepts filters, hashes them to a `request_hash`, and caches the assembled bulletin in DB. The global handler (`handle_summarise_completed`) now also uses a request_hash (empty filters `{}` → hash `44136fa355b3678a`) — same table, same idempotency logic.

**New files:**
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/selector.py` — pure functions, no IO:
  - `compute_request_hash(filters) → str` — 16-char SHA-256 hex of canonical JSON
  - `validate_filter_categories(cats) → list[str]` — validates against YAML taxonomy (leaf slugs + parent prefixes)
  - `select_stories(summaries, *, include_categories, exclude_categories, max_stories) → list[dict]` — hierarchical match, preserves ranking order
  - `_matches_any(category, patterns)` — `cat == p or cat.startswith(p + ".")`

**Migration `e7f8a9b0c1d2`:** 
- Cleared existing bulletins (test data only)
- Dropped `UNIQUE(ranking_run_id)`, added `request_hash TEXT`, `filters JSONB`, `story_count INTEGER`
- Added `UNIQUE(ranking_run_id, request_hash)` — supports multiple cached bulletins per run

**Modified files:**
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/repos/bulletin_repo.py` — replaced `get_by_ranking_run(run_id)` with `get_by_run_and_hash(run_id, request_hash)`; updated `insert()` to keyword-only with `request_hash, filters, story_count`
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/handlers/summarise_completed.py` — uses `_GLOBAL_FILTERS = {}`, `compute_request_hash(_GLOBAL_FILTERS)`, `seed=int(request_hash, 16)`; updated `insert()` call
- `api/routes/data.py` — fixed `GET /data/bulletins/latest` (was calling removed `get_by_ranking_run`); added `POST /data/bulletins/assemble` with `BulletinRequest` Pydantic model

**POST /data/bulletins/assemble:**
- Accepts `include_categories`, `exclude_categories` (both validated against YAML taxonomy), `max_stories` (default 20)
- Cache hit returns `cached=true` with no DB writes
- Cache miss: loads summaries in ranking order → applies filters → assembles → persists → returns
- Returns `{ranking_run_id, request_hash, story_count, cached, script, segments}`

**Validation (all 9 cases, run_id=13, 22 summaries):**
1. No filters → 11 stories, full bulletin ✓ (hash `44136fa355b3678a`)
2. `include_categories: ["politics"]` → 4 stories ✓ (hash `a4cc2f41796b7354`)
3. `include_categories: ["technology"]` → 1 story ✓ (hash `3360413888323386`)
4. `include_categories: ["politics", "sport"]` → 5 stories ✓ (hash `20ee8f9b8a53da1a`)
5. `max_stories: 2` → 2 stories ✓ (hash `391c98caaa222ab2`)
6. Invalid category `"not.a.real.category"` → 422 with error detail ✓
7. Same request twice → `cached=True`, no duplicate rows (6 total in DB) ✓
8. Different filters → different hashes ✓
9. 22 story_summary rows unchanged — zero LLM calls throughout ✓

**Full event chain now:**
```
data.rank.completed → handle_rank_completed → data.summarise.completed
data.summarise.completed → handle_summarise_completed → data.bulletin.assembled (global bulletin)
POST /data/bulletins/assemble → returns user-specific cached bulletin
```

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-25, session 8 — bulletin assembly)

**Architecture:**
Pure template-based assembly triggered by `data.summarise.completed`. No LLM calls. Generates once per `ranking_run_id` and reuses. Seeded by `ranking_run_id` so intro/outro are deterministic per run.

**New files:**
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/assembler.py` — `assemble(stories, seed) → BulletinResult`
  - Intro chosen from 2 options, outro from 2 options (seeded RNG, deterministic per run)
  - Category-aware transitions: `politics`, `world`, `business`, `sport`, `technology`, `entertainment`, `health`, `science`, `climate`; fallback `"Next..."`
  - Transitions inserted between stories only (not after last)
  - `audio_script` used directly; falls back to `summary_text` if empty
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/events.py` — `DATA_BULLETIN_ASSEMBLED`
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/handlers/summarise_completed.py` — `handle_summarise_completed`
  - Idempotency: checks for existing bulletin before any work
  - Loads ordering + `primary_category` from ranking run JSONB
  - Deduplicates story IDs; warns on missing summaries
  - All in single transaction: insert bulletin + emit `data.bulletin.assembled`
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/repos/bulletin_repo.py` — `get_by_ranking_run`, `get_latest`, `insert`

**Migration `d6e7f8a9b0c1`:** `data.bulletins(id, ranking_run_id UNIQUE, script TEXT, segments JSONB, created_at)`

**Modified files:**
- `ranking/repos/ranking_run_repo.py` — added `get_by_id(run_id)`
- `platform/queue/registry_wiring.py` — `data.summarise.completed → handle_summarise_completed`
- `api/routes/data.py` — added `GET /data/bulletins/latest`

**Validation (run_id=13, 11 stories):**
- First assembly: bulletin created, `story_count=11`
- Segment sequence: `intro → story → [transition → story] × 10 → outro` ✓
- Top stories before briefing ✓
- No missing stories ✓
- No duplicate stories ✓
- Idempotency: second run logged `bulletin already exists — skipping`, `COUNT(*) = 1` ✓
- Category transitions working: politics/world/technology/sport all correctly matched

**Full event chain now:**
```
data.rank.completed → handle_rank_completed → data.summarise.completed
data.summarise.completed → handle_summarise_completed → data.bulletin.assembled
```

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-25, session 7b — summarisation hardening)

**Cost control:**
- Pre-check: `get_existing_story_ids(ranking_run_id)` — skips stories already summarised for this run before any LLM call
- Content-hash cache: `get_cached(story_id, content_hash, model)` — reuses summaries from previous runs when article content is unchanged; inserts a copy row with new `ranking_run_id` for provenance
- Session isolation: DB session closed before LLM calls; no connection held open during network waits
- All three paths logged at INFO: `GENERATED`, `REUSE`, `FAILED`; `data.summarise.completed` payload carries `{attempted, generated, reused, failed}`

**New migration `c5d6e7f8a9b0`:** Added `content_hash TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` + `confidence REAL` to `data.story_summaries`; partial index on `(story_id, content_hash, model) WHERE content_hash != ''`

**Prompt rewrite (`llm_summariser.py`):**
- Explicit instruction: "Summarise the story as a whole, not each article individually"
- "Base every fact only on the supplied article text. Do not add external knowledge or speculation."
- "If articles conflict, acknowledge uncertainty neutrally"
- `audio_script`: "natural spoken language for broadcast radio — no article-style prose, write as if spoken aloud"
- Returns `confidence` (LLM self-rating 0-1) as separate field

**Output shape confirmed:** `headline`, `summary_text`, `why_it_matters`, `audio_script`, `confidence`, `model`, `summary_version` — all fields persisted and returned by API

**API fix (`GET /data/summaries/latest`):**
- Summaries now returned in ranking order (top_stories first, then briefing)
- Response includes `summary_count`
- All output fields including `confidence` and `summary_version`

**Validation (mock LLM):**
- Generate run: 11 LLM calls → 11 rows, `generated=11 reused=0 failed=0`
- Idempotency run: 0 LLM calls, row count unchanged
- Cache hit confirmed: story_id + content_hash → existing headline returned
- Fail-closed: all 11 stories `FAILED` with no API key, 0 rows inserted, `data.summarise.completed` still emitted

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-25, session 7 — summarisation stage)

**Architecture:**
Story-level summarisation triggered by `data.rank.completed`. Two-session DB access pattern: read-only articles load first, then persist summaries + emit event. Fail closed when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not set.

**New files:**
- `pipeline/data/summarise/llm_summariser.py` — `summarise_story(story_id, representative_title, articles) → SummaryResult | None`
  - Uses stdlib `urllib.request` (no new dependency)
  - Model from `SUMMARISE_MODEL` env var (default `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)
  - Structured prompt → `{headline, summary_text, why_it_matters, audio_script}`
  - Strips markdown code fences; fails closed on parse error
- `pipeline/data/summarise/handlers/rank_completed.py` — `handle_rank_completed`
  - Deduplicates story IDs (top + briefing), loads articles per story (up to 5, most recent first)
  - Calls `summarise_story` per story; skips LLM failures silently
  - Persists to `data.story_summaries` with `ON CONFLICT (story_id, ranking_run_id) DO NOTHING`
  - Emits `data.summarise.completed` in same transaction
- `pipeline/data/summarise/repos/story_summary_repo.py` — `StorySummaryRepo.get_by_ranking_run(run_id)`
- `alembic/versions/b4c5d6e7f8a9_add_story_summaries.py` — `data.story_summaries` table

**Modified files:**
- `ranking/handlers/categorise_completed.py` — captures `run_id` from `insert_run()`, emits `data.rank.completed` (same transaction) with payload: `ranking_run_id`, `ranking_batch_id`, `categorisation_batch_id`, `top_story_ids`, `briefing_story_ids`
- `pipeline/data/summarise/models.py` — replaced article-level `SummariseOutput` with story-level `StorySummary`
- `pipeline/data/summarise/handlers/requested.py` — replaced stub with no-op (old article-level flow unused)
- `platform/queue/registry_wiring.py` — registered `data.rank.completed → handle_rank_completed`
- `api/routes/data.py` — added `GET /data/summaries/latest`

**Database schema:**
```sql
data.story_summaries (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    story_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    ranking_run_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES data.ranking_runs(id),
    headline TEXT NOT NULL,
    summary_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    why_it_matters TEXT,
    audio_script TEXT,
    model VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    summary_version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE (story_id, ranking_run_id)
)
```

**Event payload (`data.rank.completed`):**
```json
{
  "ranking_run_id": 10,
  "ranking_batch_id": "...",
  "categorisation_batch_id": "...",
  "top_story_ids": ["33", "41", "52", "57", "50"],
  "briefing_story_ids": ["51", "45", "58", "32", "42", "55"]
}
```

**Validation (no API key — fail-closed path):**
- `handle_categorise_completed` emits `data.rank.completed` with correct payload (verified in outbox)
- `handle_rank_completed` loads articles for 11 stories, returns None for all (no key), emits `data.summarise.completed` with `story_count=0`
- `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` idempotency confirmed

**To generate real summaries:**
1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key>` to `.env`
2. Trigger a fresh ingest: `POST /data/ingest/test`
3. View summaries: `GET /data/summaries/latest`

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-26 — physical device readiness)

**Problem 1 — `APIClient.swift` compilation bug:**
`post`, `put`, and `request` methods were defined outside the struct closing brace. Code would not compile. Fixed by rewriting the file: extracted `buildURL()` and `send()` as private helpers; all methods now inside the struct.

**Problem 2 — ATS blocks HTTP to LAN IPs on device:**
`NSAllowsLocalNetworking` only covers `127.0.0.1`/`.local`. Physical device hitting `http://<dev-machine-ip>:8000` is blocked by default ATS. The project uses `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES` (no Info.plist exists), so ATS can't be configured without creating one.

**Problem 3 — URL hardcoded to 127.0.0.1:**
Simulator-only default. Device needs Mac LAN IP.

**Files changed:**
- `Core/APIClient.swift` — rewrote to fix struct closure bug; extracted `buildURL()` + `send()` helpers; all methods now inside struct
- `Core/AppConfig.swift` — `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)` auto-selects `127.0.0.1` for simulator, `deviceLANIP` constant for device; one-time edit: set `deviceLANIP = "<dev-machine-ip>"` (current Mac LAN IP)
- `Headlines/Info.plist` — **new file** replacing auto-generated plist:
  - Replicates all `INFOPLIST_KEY_*` build settings (UIApplicationSceneManifest, UILaunchScreen, UISupportedInterfaceOrientations, etc.)
  - Adds `NSAppTransportSecurity`: `NSAllowsLocalNetworking = true`, `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInDebug = true` (debug builds only — no ATS impact on release)
  - Adds `API_BASE_URL = $(API_BASE_URL)` build variable hook for per-scheme URL override

**Required Xcode steps (one-time, manual):**
1. In Xcode project navigator: right-click `Headlines` group → Add Files → select `Info.plist`
2. Build Settings → search "Generate Info.plist" → set to **No** for Debug and Release
3. Build Settings → search "Info.plist File" → set to `Headlines/Info.plist`
4. In `AppConfig.swift` line `static let deviceLANIP = "YOUR_MAC_LAN_IP"` → replace with `"<dev-machine-ip>"` (or your current LAN IP — run `ipconfig getifaddr en0` to check)

**Audio URL handling (all cases covered):**
| Scenario | `audioUrl` in response | How iOS downloads |
|---|---|---|
| Local dev (simulator) | `null` | `service.audioFileURL()` → `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dev/api/audio/{id}/file` |
| Local dev (device) | `null` | `service.audioFileURL()` → `http://<dev-machine-ip>:8000/dev/api/audio/{id}/file` |
| S3 production | `https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/...` | URL used directly, no Mac involved |

**Validation:**
- `GET http://<dev-machine-ip>:8000/data/profiles` → `200 {"profiles":[...]}` ✓
- `GET http://<dev-machine-ip>:8000/dev/api/audio/13/file` → `200 1,587,453 bytes` ✓
- Backend bound to `0.0.0.0:8000` (uvicorn `--host 0.0.0.0`) ✓
- No hardcoded `127.0.0.1` outside `AppConfig.swift` ✓

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-26 — audio storage abstraction)

**Architecture:**
Replaced direct local-disk writes in `_generate_audio()` with a pluggable storage provider. Provider is selected at startup from `AUDIO_STORAGE_PROVIDER` env var. `local` mode is unchanged (writes `.local/audio/bulletins/`). `s3` mode uploads to any S3-compatible bucket and derives a public URL. `audio_url` is now persisted in DB and returned in all audio API responses. iOS uses `audio_url` directly when non-null; falls back to local dev path otherwise.

**New files:**
- `platform/storage/__init__.py`
- `platform/storage/audio_storage.py`
  - `AudioStorageResult(storage_path, audio_url)` — dataclass
  - `AudioStorageProvider` — ABC with `store(bytes, filename) → AudioStorageResult`
  - `LocalAudioStorage(base_dir)` — writes to local disk; `audio_url=None`
  - `S3AudioStorage(bucket, region, access_key_id, secret_access_key, endpoint_url?, public_base_url?)` — uploads with boto3
    - URL derivation: `public_base_url/{key}` → `endpoint_url/{bucket}/{key}` → `https://{bucket}.s3.{region}.amazonaws.com/{key}`
  - `get_audio_storage_provider()` — lazy singleton; validates required S3 config at startup

**Migration `b3c4d5e6f7a8`:**
- `ALTER TABLE data.bulletin_audio ADD COLUMN audio_url TEXT` (nullable)
- Existing local rows get `audio_url = NULL` (correct — local mode never stores a URL)

**Modified files:**
- `platform/config/settings.py` — added 7 new settings:
  ```
  audio_storage_provider: str = "local"
  s3_bucket, s3_region, s3_access_key_id, s3_secret_access_key
  s3_endpoint_url, s3_public_base_url (all str | None)
  ```
- `pipeline/data/bulletin/audio/repos/bulletin_audio_repo.py`
  - `get_cached()` SELECT now includes `audio_url`
  - `insert()` accepts `audio_url: str | None = None`, includes in INSERT
- `api/routes/data.py`
  - Removed direct `os.makedirs` / `open()` writes
  - Added `get_audio_storage_provider()` call; passes `stored.audio_url` to DB insert
  - `_do_assemble_and_audio()` response and `generate_bulletin_audio` endpoint both now include `"audio_url"` key
- `.env` — added `AUDIO_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local` and commented S3 stubs
- `pyproject.toml` — added `boto3 = {version = "^1.35.0", optional = true}` + `[tool.poetry.extras] s3 = ["boto3"]`

**iOS files:**
- `Models/BulletinResult.swift` — added `audioUrl: String?`
- `Services/Profiles/ProfileDTO.swift` — added `audioUrl: String?` to `BulletinResultDTO` (CodingKey: `audio_url`)
- `Services/Profiles/ProfileService.swift` — `BulletinResult.init(dto:)` maps `audioUrl`
- `Features/Briefing/BriefingViewModel.swift` — uses `result.audioUrl` directly if non-nil; falls back to `service.audioFileURL(forBulletinID:)` for local dev

**Env vars:**
```
AUDIO_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local     # local (default) | s3

# S3 mode — required when AUDIO_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3:
S3_BUCKET=my-headlines-audio
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# Optional:
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://<acct>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com   # R2, Spaces, MinIO
S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://cdn.example.com                 # CDN domain override
```

**To install boto3 (S3 mode only):**
```bash
cd backend && poetry install -E s3
```

**Example API response (local mode, audio_url=null):**
```json
{
  "profile_id": 1, "profile_name": "Paul",
  "bulletin_id": 13, "story_count": 5,
  "bulletin_cached": true,
  "audio_id": 7, "voice": "JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb",
  "audio_url": null,
  "audio_cached": true
}
```

**Example API response (S3 mode):**
```json
{
  "audio_url": "https://my-headlines.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bulletins/13_b23b5858afd5c157.mp3",
  "audio_cached": false
}
```

**Validation (all 5 checks passing):**
1. `get_audio_storage_provider()` in local mode → `LocalAudioStorage` ✓
2. Missing S3 config → `RuntimeError: required env vars missing: S3_BUCKET, S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID, S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` ✓
3. `LocalAudioStorage.store()` → `audio_url=None`, file written correctly ✓
4. URL derivation for all 3 S3 modes (AWS / endpoint / CDN) ✓
5. `POST /data/bulletins/13/audio` (cache hit) → `"audio_url": null, "cached": true` ✓
6. `GET /dev/api/audio/13/file` → `200 audio/mpeg 1.5MB` (local file serving unchanged) ✓
7. `get_cached()` includes `audio_url` column in result ✓

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-27 — iOS device fixes)

**Three bugs fixed on physical iPhone:**

**1. Device IP placeholder** (`Core/AppConfig.swift`)
- `deviceLANIP = "YOUR_MAC_LAN_IP"` → `"<dev-machine-ip>"`
- Was causing `NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1003` (host not found) on every request

**2. Error logging — response body swallowed** (`Core/APIClient.swift`, `Core/AudioPlayer.swift`, `Features/Playback/PlaybackViewModel.swift`)
- `APIError.badStatus(Int)` → `badStatus(Int, String)` — now carries response body snippet
- `send()` prints `⚠️ API METHOD URL → STATUS: body` in DEBUG builds
- Surfaces backend error detail (e.g. `"No ranking runs found"`) instead of just a status code

**3. Audio silent on device** (`Core/AudioPlayer.swift`, `Features/Briefing/BriefingViewModel.swift`)
- Root cause: `AVAudioPlayer.play()` uses `.soloAmbient` session by default — silenced by mute switch on device, works fine in simulator
- Fix: `play()` now calls `AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback)` + `setActive(true)` before every play
- Defensive fix: `resolvedAudioURL()` helper in `BriefingViewModel` rejects `audio_url` values with `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` host and falls back to `audioFileURL(forBulletinID:)` which resolves against `AppConfig.apiBaseURL` (LAN IP on device)
- Debug logging added: final audio URL, download byte count, failure body

**Ingest configuration (read-only inspection, no changes):**
- Scheduled ingest: `ENABLE_SCHEDULED_INGEST=false` (disabled), 30-min interval when on
- Per-run fetch: 10 articles from GNews `top-headlines`, `lang=en`, `country=gb`
- No env var for `max_results` or country/lang — hardcoded in handler
- Dedup: SHA-256 of URL checked before every insert; no duplicates stored
- Ranking window: 48 hours (hardcoded in `candidate_loader.py`)

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-26 — iOS frontend architecture refactor)

**Goal:** Establish a disciplined feature-based iOS architecture before adding more UI. No product behaviour changes.

**Architecture applied:**
```
Core/           — app-wide utilities (APIClient, AppConfig, AudioPlayer)
Models/         — plain value types (Profile, BulletinResult)
Services/       — protocol + concrete service per domain
Features/       — one folder per screen; ViewModel owns state, View owns layout
Shared/Components/ — generic reusable views only
```

**New files (10):**
- `Core/AudioPlayer.swift` — `@MainActor final class`; wraps `AVAudioPlayer`; static `download(from:id:)` method; `progress`, `isAtEnd`, `duration` computed props; `play/pause/stop/load`
- `Services/BulletinService.swift` — `BulletinServicing` protocol + `BulletinService` impl; private `BulletinResultDTO` (moved from ProfileDTO.swift); `audioFileURL(forBulletinID:)` uses `URLComponents`
- `Features/Profiles/ProfileListView.swift` — extracted from `ProfilePickerSheet` at bottom of `BriefingView.swift`; renamed to match feature folder
- `Features/Briefing/PlayerView.swift` — extracted `playerCard`; takes `progress`, `duration`, `canTogglePlayPause`, `isPlaying`, `bulletin`, `onTogglePlayPause`; owns `cacheBadge` and `formatTime` helpers
- `Features/Briefing/BriefingLoadingView.swift` — handles `.loadingProfiles` (shows `LoadingStateView`) and `.noProfiles` (shows `PrimaryButton`)
- `Features/Briefing/BriefingErrorView.swift` — thin wrapper around `ErrorStateView`
- `Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift` — stub showing `AppConfig.apiBaseURL.host` + port for device debugging
- `Shared/Components/PrimaryButton.swift` — `.borderedProminent` button wrapper
- `Shared/Components/LoadingStateView.swift` — `ProgressView()` + message
- `Shared/Components/ErrorStateView.swift` — error icon + title + message + retry button

**Modified files (5):**
- `Services/Profiles/ProfileServicing.swift` — removed `generateBulletin` and `audioFileURL`; now only profile CRUD
- `Services/Profiles/ProfileService.swift` — removed `generateBulletin`, `audioFileURL`, `BulletinResult` mapping
- `Services/Profiles/ProfileDTO.swift` — removed `BulletinResultDTO` (moved to `BulletinService.swift` as private)
- `Features/Briefing/BriefingViewModel.swift` — removed AVFoundation import; split `service: ProfileServicing` into `profileService + bulletinService`; uses `AudioPlayer` for all playback; `generateBulletin()` delegates download to `AudioPlayer.download()`
- `Features/Briefing/BriefingView.swift` — removed `ProfilePickerSheet`, `loadingView`, `noProfilesView`, `errorView`, `playerCard`, `cacheBadge`, `formatTime`, `playPauseIcon`; replaced with calls to extracted components; `vm.service` → `vm.profileService`

**All 10 files added to Xcode target membership** via `xcodeproj` Ruby gem.

**Build result:** `BUILD SUCCEEDED` (iPhone 15 simulator, iOS 17.5)

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-27 — iOS redesign, story nav, summary quality, bulletin flow)

### Task 1 — iOS Briefing Screen Redesign
- `BriefingView.swift` — full rewrite: uppercase letter-spaced context label, `storiesSection` with separator + story count label, story rows with isCurrent highlight + tap-to-seek, `categoryDisplay()` helper, premium minimal layout
- `PlayerView.swift` — full rewrite: ZStack prev/play/next layout, 80pt play button, 3px progress bar, `.tertiary` time labels, nav buttons invisible when no timing data

### Task 2 — Story Visibility
- Backend: `_do_assemble_and_audio()` builds `stories_list` with headline/category/start_time; cached + fresh paths both populate it; returned as `"stories"` key
- iOS: `BulletinStory` model + `BulletinStoryDTO` decoder; `BriefingView.storyRows()` shows headlines with category labels

### Task 3 — Fix TTS 503
- Root cause: profile voice `P4DhdyNCB4Nl6MA0sL45` (ElevenLabs "Rachel") requires paid plan → HTTP 402
- `tts_client.py`: helpers now read `settings.*` not `os.environ.get()` (pydantic-settings doesn't populate environ)
- Added specific 401/402 warning messages; profile 1 voice cleared to `null` → falls back to George
- `mp3_duration()` pure stdlib MPEG1 frame scanner added to `tts_client.py`

### Task 4 — Prev/Next Story Navigation
- Proportional timestamps: `_story_timings(segments, script, duration)` computes `start_time` per story from char offset in assembled script
- `AudioPlayer.swift`: `currentTime` property + `seek(to:)` method
- `BriefingViewModel`: `currentStoryIndex`, `hasStoryTimings`, `seekToStory(at:)`, `previousStory()`, `nextStory()`, `resolveCurrentStoryIndex(at:)`, `tick()` updates highlight on playback
- `BulletinResult`/`BulletinStory` models updated with `startTime: TimeInterval?`

### Task 5 — Story Summary Quality
- `llm_summariser.py` `_build_prompt()` rewrite: explicit forbidden opener list, sentence rhythm guidance, contractions OK, concrete closing line, `why_it_matters` prohibition list ("ongoing concerns", "raises questions about", etc.)
- `_MAX_TOKENS` 512 → 600
- `settings.anthropic_api_key` used directly (was `os.environ.get`)

### Task 6 — Bulletin Flow Quality
- `assembler.py` full rewrite:
  - `_extract_hook()` — pulls first sentence of top story's `audio_script` as intro hook
  - `_build_intro()` — hooks with top story, bridges with "That story leads / We begin there / That leads today", then time-of-day greeting + name; falls back to date-based if no hook
  - `_build_outro()` — forward-looking: "We'll keep following these stories as they develop", "More on all of this as it comes in", time-aware (morning/afternoon/evening) — replaces "That's all for now"
  - `_CATEGORY_TRANSITIONS` expanded: 6-8 options per category (was 2-3), added "Politically...", "Overseas...", "Economically speaking...", "On the digital front...", etc.
  - `_NEUTRAL_TRANSITIONS` expanded: 14 options (was 4), added "At the same time...", "On a related note...", "Also making news...", "Away from that...", "Closer to home..."
- `POST /data/profiles/{id}/bulletin?force=true` — bypass cache for dev/testing (deletes existing bulletin + audio rows, re-assembles and re-generates TTS)

**Live validation (force=true, profile 1, 3 stories):**
- Intro: "Authorities have arrested... That leads today. Good evening, Paul." ✓ (hooks with story)
- Transition: "In government..." (politics.uk), "On the sporting front..." (sport) ✓
- Outro: "That's the evening briefing, Paul. More updates throughout the day." ✓ (forward-looking)

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-27 — Task 7: include_top_stories + category filter UI)

### Backend

**Migration `0f1c2e3a4b5d`** — `ALTER TABLE data.profiles ADD COLUMN include_top_stories BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true`

**`profile_repo.py`** — `include_top_stories` added to `_ALLOWED_UPDATE_FIELDS`, `create()`, all `SELECT` queries

**`profiles.py`** — `ProfileCreate.include_top_stories: bool = True`, `ProfileUpdate.include_top_stories: Optional[bool] = None`, `_fmt()` includes the field, bulletin route passes it to `_do_assemble_and_audio()`

**`data.py`** — Two changes:
- `GET /data/categories` — returns `{"categories": [...sorted slugs...]}` from taxonomy YAML (mirrors `/dev/api/categories` but on the public router)
- `_do_assemble_and_audio(include_top_stories=True)` — `include_top_stories` included in `filters` dict (affects cache key); when `True`: top-tier stories always included first regardless of category filters, remaining slots filled from briefing tier applying category filters; when `False`: current behaviour (filter applied to entire merged pool)

### iOS

**`Profile.swift`** — added `includeTopStories: Bool`

**`ProfileDTO.swift`** — added `includeTopStories` to `ProfileDTO` (CodingKey: `include_top_stories`), `CreateProfileBody`, `UpdateProfileBody`

**`ProfileServicing.swift`** — `createProfile` and `updateProfile` now take `includeTopStories: Bool`

**`ProfileService.swift`** — passes `includeTopStories` in request bodies and `Profile.init(dto:)` mapping

**`Models/CategoryLoader.swift`** (new) — `CategoryListDTO`, `fetchTopCategories()` — calls `GET /data/categories`, derives top-level slugs by splitting on `.`, returns sorted unique list

**`ProfileFormView.swift`** — redesigned with:
- **Identity section**: Name + Max Stories stepper (unchanged)
- **Voice section**: Picker (unchanged)
- **Listening section**: Toggle "Include top stories" + footer helper text
- **Filters section**: checkboxes for each top-level category (loaded async); checked slugs → `include_categories`; no categories checked = nil (no filter); replaces old include/exclude text fields
- `selectedCategories: Set<String>` state; `categoryBinding(for:)` helper; parallel `.task` fetches voices + categories simultaneously

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-27 — product settings + taxonomy refinement)

### Part 1 — Category hierarchy in UI

**`category_loader.py`** — added `load_category_groups()`:
- Returns two-level hierarchy (top-level groups + their direct children)
- Special display name mapping: `politics.uk` → "UK Politics", `politics.us` → "US Politics", `politics.europe` → "European Politics", `politics.global` → "World Politics", `ai` → "AI", `tv-film` → "TV & Film", `formula1` → "Formula 1", etc.
- Three-level nesting (sport.football.premier-league) collapsed — only top two levels exposed to UI

**`data.py`** — `GET /data/categories` now returns `{"groups": [...]}` hierarchy instead of flat slug list

**iOS `CategoryLoader.swift`** — rewritten:
- New `CategoryGroup` (slug, label, subcategories) and `CategoryItem` (slug, label) types
- Decodes new `{"groups": [...]}` API shape
- Cache, timeout, and DEBUG logging preserved

**iOS `ProfileFormView.swift`** — Filters section rewritten:
- Per-group sections with group label as section header
- Each subcategory is a toggle with display label
- Leaf groups (science, climate, health) render as single toggles using group slug
- `filtersSections` uses `@ViewBuilder` with `ForEach` over groups

### Part 2 — Remove voice options

**iOS `ProfileFormView.swift`** — removed Voice section and `voices` state; always passes `voice: nil` on save
**Dev dashboard** — voice `<select>` replaced with `<input type="hidden" value="">` (keeps `voiceLabel()` working in audio list)

### Part 3 — Duration-based story selection

**Migration `1a2b3c4d5e6f`** — drops `max_stories`, adds `max_duration_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 5` on `data.profiles`; applied

**`selector.py`** — added:
- `estimate_duration_seconds(audio_script)` — word count / 150 wpm * 60
- `select_stories_by_duration(summaries, *, include_categories, exclude_categories, max_duration_minutes)` — selects stories fitting within budget; always takes at least one; respects category filters

**`profile_repo.py`** — `max_stories` → `max_duration_minutes` everywhere (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE)

**`profiles.py`** — `ProfileCreate.max_duration_minutes: int = 5`, `ProfileUpdate.max_duration_minutes: Optional[int] = None`, `_fmt()` returns `max_duration_minutes`, bulletin route passes `max_duration_minutes`

**`data.py`** — `AssembleAudioRequest.max_duration_minutes: int = 5`; `_do_assemble_and_audio` now:
- Takes `max_duration_minutes` instead of `max_stories`
- Uses `select_stories_by_duration()` for all story selection
- For `include_top_stories=True`: top pool selected by duration first, remaining minutes filled from briefing pool with category filter
- Response includes `target_duration_minutes` and `estimated_duration_seconds` (estimated from assembled script)

**iOS `Profile.swift`** — `maxStories: Int` → `maxDurationMinutes: Int`
**iOS `ProfileDTO.swift`** — `maxDurationMinutes: Int` (CodingKey: `max_duration_minutes`) in DTO and both request bodies
**iOS `ProfileServicing.swift` / `ProfileService.swift`** — `maxStories` → `maxDurationMinutes` throughout
**iOS `ProfileFormView.swift`** — max stories `Stepper` replaced with segmented `Picker` (3 min / 5 min / 10 min); `populateForm` snaps to nearest valid option
**iOS `ProfileListView.swift`** — subtitle changed from "N stories ·" to "N min ·"

**Build result:** `BUILD SUCCEEDED`

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-29 — audio experience wiring + validation)

### Gaps closed

**`src/core/pipeline/data/summarise/handlers/rank_completed.py`** — category pass-through:
- Added `story_categories: dict[str, str | None] = {}` to Phase 1 locals
- Batch-queries `data.stories.primary_category` for all pending story IDs in Phase 1 DB session (one `ANY(:ids)` query, no N+1)
- Phase 2 now passes `category=story_categories.get(story_id)` to `summarise_story()` so LLM tone guidance actually fires

**`src/core/api/routes/data.py`** — `is_first_bulletin` detection:
- Added JSONB COUNT query before `assemble()` call: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM data.bulletins WHERE filters @> jsonb_build_object('name', :name)`
- Zero prior rows → `is_first_bulletin=True` → first-time intro template fires
- Only runs when `name` is set and no cached bulletin already exists
- `assemble()` call now passes `is_first_bulletin=is_first_bulletin`

**Bulletin cache cleared** — deleted 8 `bulletin_audio` rows then 8 `data.bulletins` rows for profile "Paul" (FK-ordered, no data loss; these were all old cached bulletins assembled before the new assembler code).

### Validation (script-only — ElevenLabs credits exhausted)

Direct Python assembly test (`ranking_run_id=16`, 5 stories, `name="Paul"`, `is_first_bulletin=True`):

```
INTRO:  "Good to have you, Paul. Let's start you off."   ← first-time template
STORY 1: climate  — High pressure / mostly dry week
TRANS:  [silent pause]                                    ← ~15% pause roll
STORY 2: politics.uk — King Charles US visit security
TRANS:  "In public health..."                             ← category-matched
STORY 3: health   — Wife spots dementia signs
TRANS:  "Over in Westminster..."                          ← category-matched
STORY 4: politics.us — White House press dinner arrest
TRANS:  "Something a little more cheerful..."             ← tonal bridge (heavy→lighter)
STORY 5: world.us — Yellow fever surge warning
OUTRO:  "That's everything for now. Back later if anything breaks."  ← 2-part morning
```

299 words · 5 stories · 11 segments — within 3-minute target.

**Note:** Existing summaries in DB were generated before the category-aware prompt was wired. Cached summaries (same story content) will be reused as-is; new tone-guided summaries will only appear when story content changes on the next ingest cycle.

**ElevenLabs quota:** ~45 credits remaining. Need top-up or switch to `TTS_PROVIDER=openai` before next audio generation.

## Changes Made This Session (2026-04-28 — audio experience pass)

### Files changed

**`src/core/pipeline/data/summarise/llm_summariser.py`** — prompt + config only:
- `_MAX_TOKENS` 600 → 950 (supports longer summaries)
- `summarise_story()` gains optional `category: str | None = None` parameter (backward compatible)
- `_TONE_GUIDANCE` dict: category → tone instruction (8 categories)
- `_build_prompt()` gains `category` parameter; passes tone guidance to LLM
- `audio_script` target: 70-85 words → 4-6 sentences, 120-180 words
- First sentence of `audio_script` must be a hook: specific fact + tension + no banned openers
- Extended forbidden phrases: added "officials are considering", "the situation remains", "many are wondering", "in a developing story", "more on this as it unfolds", "the story continues to develop", "it remains unclear", "amid uncertainty"
- Forward-looking close requirement added
- Specific-fact requirement (one per two sentences) added
- Snippet length 300 → 400 chars per article

**`src/core/pipeline/data/bulletin/pronunciation.py`** (new):
- `normalise_numbers()` — converts £2.3bn → "2.3 billion pounds", 10% → "10 percent"
- `normalise_acronyms()` — spaces HMRC, DVLA, ASOS (observed ElevenLabs problem cases)
- `apply_pronunciation_overrides()` — whole-word substitutions for 18 proper nouns
- `normalise_for_tts()` — master pass applied to assembled script before TTS
- `PRONUNCIATION_OVERRIDES` dict as extension point; `_ACRONYM_AS_WORD` documents leave-as-is set

**`src/core/pipeline/data/bulletin/transitions.py`** (new):
- 97 total transition phrases (≥ 80 target): 10 per category × 9 categories (90) + 8 tonal heavy→light + 6 tonal light→heavy + 9 geographic + 7 thematic + 14 neutral
- `_is_heavy()` heuristic: category ∈ {world, health, climate, politics} + heavy keyword in story text
- `pick_transition()`: takes previous/next story, position, total count, used set; ~15% pause; biases toward tonal bridges after heavy stories; full bulletin dedup via `used_in_bulletin` set

**`src/core/pipeline/data/bulletin/intros.py`** (new):
- 15 named template functions (all distinct rhythm/structure)
- `_FIRST_TIME_TEMPLATES` — 3 friendlier first-bulletin variants
- `_BRIDGES` pool — 8 hook→greeting bridges
- `build_intro()`: time-of-day filtering, story-count awareness, name enforcement (name always appears when provided), is_first_bulletin support
- `_extract_hook()` — pulls first sentence of `audio_script` (20-220 char sentence boundary)
- `_est_minutes()` — rough spoken duration estimate from story count

**`src/core/pipeline/data/bulletin/outros.py`** (new):
- 8 caught-up variants with name + story count (e.g. "Five stories and you're sorted, Paul.")
- 8 caught-up variants without name
- 6 morning / 6 afternoon / 6 evening forward phrases
- `_SIGNOFFS` pool with blank-weighted distribution
- `build_outro()`: 3 structure variants (1-part 20%, 2-part 45%, 3-part 35%); name used ~55% of time

**`src/core/pipeline/data/bulletin/assembler.py`** (rewritten):
- Imports and delegates to all four new modules
- Passes `used_in_bulletin` set to `pick_transition()` for full within-bulletin dedup
- Passes previous + next story dicts to transition selector
- Applies `normalise_for_tts()` to final assembled script
- `is_first_bulletin` parameter plumbed through to `build_intro()`
- Filters empty-string transitions (pause) from script join but preserves paragraph break

## What Is Incomplete

- **Summaries require API key** — set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` to activate
- **S3 boto3 not installed** — run `poetry install -E s3` before switching to S3 mode
- **No automated tests** — pipeline health check devtool covers ingest→cluster; no unit/integration tests

## Next Steps

- Install boto3 and test S3 upload against a real bucket (R2 recommended — free tier)
- Wire summaries/bulletins into feeds/scripts/audio pipeline stages (TTS stage)
- `GET /data/bulletins/latest` returns most recently *created* bulletin — may want `GET /data/bulletins/assemble?cached_only=true` variant
